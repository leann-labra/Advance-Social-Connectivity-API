## DESCRIPTION

This application was made to practice building a RESTful API using a cloud database. Through this project I built routes to access models that access stored data in mongoDB. There is no front end to this project as this project is practicing backend server building skills. One of the bigger challenges I faced in this project is properly setting up the routes so that it would work properly. I did get my backend seed data to load onto mongodb, and the routes on insomnia would throw a 200 OK http status which shows that my routes went thorugh but for some reason would not pull the data. I still have much to learn but this what I got so far and I'm excited to getting better as time goes on!

## TEST

since this is a backend server and does not have a front end to interact with, please checkout my video above which outlines my routes!

- in your command line enter "npm i" to download the necessary packages.
- then, enter "npm run seed" to seed some sample data I've included from mockaroo
- then run either "npm run start" or "npm run dev"
