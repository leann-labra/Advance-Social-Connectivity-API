## DESCRIPTION

My goal for this project was to develop skills in building a RESTful API using a cloud database such as MongoDB. I particularly wanted to hone in on practicing my backend development skills focusing primarily on creating efficient routes to interact with the stored data. 

Although this project does not include a front end as of yet, it does serve as foundational exercise in backend server construction. Once of the significant challenges I faced throughout this project was learning how to set up my routes correctly to ensure proper functionality. Despite successfully loading seed data into MongoDB and receiving a "200 OK" status update in Insomnia, the routes did not retrieve the data as expected. In all, this experience highlighted areas where I can commit to further learning and improvement. 

In hindsight, this experience has highlighted areas in my skillset that still need further development. I look forward to overcoming these challenges as I continue to grow. 

## TEST

since this is a backend server and does not have a front end to interact with, please checkout my video above which outlines my routes!

- in your command line enter "npm i" to download the necessary packages.
- then, enter "npm run seed" to seed some sample data I've included from mockaroo
- then run either "npm run start" or "npm run dev"
