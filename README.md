## DESCRIPTION

This application was made to practice building a RESTful API using a cloud database. Through this project I built routes to access models that access stored data in mongoDB. There is no front end to this project as this project is practicing backend server building skills. One of the bigger challenges I faced in this project is properly setting up the routes so that it would work properly.
